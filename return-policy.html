        <h1>What is urbanic's Return policy? How does it work?</h1>
        <p>We're happy to share about the Return policy offered to our customers.
           With this option, if you don't like the product or if there is any issue, 
           you will have the option of requesting the return request within 
          10 days (Majority of items are returnable, with the exception of lingerie, 
          jewelry, holiday accessories and some surfer swimsuits. 
          It varies from product to product so please check the product details page for more information) from product delivery.
           At this moment, we are not able to facilitate the exchange of the products. 
           The only requirement of the return policy is that the item you're returning should be in its actual conditions.
            Tags and packaging should remain intact and the dress should not have been used.
             Once the item is received at the warehouse, there will be a quality check post which the refund will be processed.
              You're more than welcome to try on the product; however, please take adequate measure to avoid any damage to the product.</p>
